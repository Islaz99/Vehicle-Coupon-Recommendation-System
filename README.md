# Vehicle Coupon Recommendation System

## EDA

The *VCR.twb* file is an EDA report generated by tableau. It includes the following parts. 

*Note: an update version is on the way.*

1. Uni-variable analysis
  * Demographic
  * Customer preferences
  * Coupon distribution （use type & expiration）
2. Bi-variable analysis
  * Prefecence differences among customers
  * Distribution differences among customers (if there's)
  * Acceptance preference in different context, on different customers and for different coupons
  
## Modeling (inluding EDA) 

The modeling is objected to improve the ditribution effectiveness of the recommendation system, namely predict if a customer will accept a coupon.
